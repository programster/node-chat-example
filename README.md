A simple node chat example based on [a post I read on codeproject.com](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/871622/Writing-a-Chat-Server-using-Node-js-TypeScript-and)


## How To Run
Make sure you have installed [NodeJs](http://blog.programster.org/install-nodejs/).

Go to the server folder and execute:
```
npm start
```

Go to the client folder and double click index.html to open it in your browser.

Press f12 to look at the console. You should see messages.
